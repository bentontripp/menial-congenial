## Introduction

I distinctly remember my very first math class as an undergrad. I was majoring in Mechanical Engineering with no background in Computer Science or any form of programming. I was a bit of a math wiz growing up, but to be honest, I very naively thought that I could get away with just coasting through school and a career without worrying about developing any real computer skills. However, after introducing the Calc 2 course that first day, my professor acknowledged that the school had recently invested in campus-wide access to [MATLAB]( https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). He explained that learning how to use it would not only be helpful as a resource to check homework answers, but also a game-changer for any students hoping for a career in engineering. This sparked my interest, and eventually led me to altogether change my degree to Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. Now, I have a career as a Data Scientist.

My point isn't that every student taking a college math class needs to learn MATLAB. However, looking back I wish I could have understood that the real power of mathematics doesn't come with a paper and pencil. Computers are unbelievably powerful machines, capable of solving problems with speed and precision impossible to any person. Of course, this doesn't mean that people do not need to learn math. The potential of mathematics is reached when a person who understands the principles and theories combines their knowledge with the capabilities of modern computers. This is where education systems often fall short - they exclusively teach math without teaching students how to apply their knowledge programmatically.

### **The Purpose of this Blog**

The purpose of this blog is not to teach programming. There are already countless resources readily available for those that are genuinely interested in learning to program. Instead, this blog is meant for students who want to use computers to help them with their math homework. This is how I was first introduced to programming. When I began, I didn't really understand what was actually happening in the background. But by simply typing out the problem I could make sure that my work was correct. To me, this was a priceless resource. Furthermore, it was what inspired me to seek out a deeper understanding of computer science and actually apply the math that I was learning. I hope that by writing this blog, I not only help students to get the correct answers on their assignments, but also inspire them to dig deeper.

My blog is also not meant to teach math, although some principles might be explained briefly. Rather, it is meant to teach students how to use programming to solve math problems. I will primarliy be focusing my content on solving calculus, linear algebra, and statistics problems. However, mathematics is one of those things that builds upon prior knowledge. For students studying Algebra or Trigonometry, I am sure that some of my blogposts will cover some of the concepts taught in those courses.
